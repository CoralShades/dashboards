**[Dashibase](https://dashibase.com) is a no-code tool to build user dashboards supported by Supabase.**

This repo contains the open-source code for setting up your own Dashibase dashboard if you are interested in hosting it yourself.

Contributions welcome!

## Getting Started

**1. Clone this repository and go to the Dashibase directory**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dashibase/dashibase
cd dashibase
```

**2. Edit `src/dashibaseConfig.ts` to configure your dashboard.**

See [here](https://github.com/dashibase/dashibase/blob/main/src/dashibaseConfig.ts) for documentation on the config file.

**3. Test it locally**

We currently don't have a staging mode yet but you should be able to test it locally with your own account

```bash
npm run dev
```

**4. Deploy to your favorite server!**

**Important!** Remember to add your dashboard URL to your list of your sign-up redirect URLs in Supabase. You can find it at https://app.supabase.io/project/YOUR_PROJECT_ID/auth/settings.
