# Setup Complete! ðŸŽ‰

## What We've Done

âœ… **Identified the Issue**: The original loading problem was caused by missing database tables referenced in the configuration

âœ… **Created Database Schema**: Generated a complete database schema (`database/schema.sql`) with:
   - Financial data tables (weekly_income, weekly_wages, weekly_expenses)
   - WIP project tracking tables
   - Row Level Security (RLS) policies for role-based access
   - Sample data for testing

âœ… **Updated Configuration**: Modified `src/dashibaseConfig.ts` to use real tables instead of placeholder "my_table"

âœ… **Development Server Ready**: App is running at http://localhost:3001/

## Next Steps

### 1. Apply Database Schema
**CRITICAL**: You need to run the SQL schema in your Supabase database:

1. Go to your Supabase project dashboard: https://app.supabase.io/project/jprwawlxjogdwhmorfpj
2. Navigate to "SQL Editor" in the left sidebar
3. Copy and paste the entire content from `database/schema.sql`
4. Click "Run" to execute the script

### 2. Test the Application
After applying the database schema:

1. Visit http://localhost:3001/ in your browser
2. Login with your credentials (demi@coralshades.ai / Coral@123)
3. You should now see the dashboard with 5 pages:
   - **Weekly Income** - Sales revenue and other income data
   - **Weekly Wages** - Salary and superannuation data
   - **Weekly Expenses** - Operating expenses and cost of sales
   - **WIP Projects** - Work in progress project management
   - (The Financial Summary view may need additional setup)

### 3. Verify Role-Based Access
The database includes RLS policies for different user roles:
- **Admin**: Can view all data
- **Role A (Sales & Marketing)**: Can view basic project data
- **Role B (Finance & HR)**: Can view all financial data

To change user roles, update the `profiles` table in Supabase:
```sql
UPDATE public.profiles 
SET role = 'admin' 
WHERE id = 'your-user-uuid';
```

## Troubleshooting

If you still see "Loading...Almost there!" after applying the schema:
1. Check browser console for any errors
2. Verify all tables were created in Supabase
3. Ensure your user account exists in the `profiles` table
4. Check that RLS policies are applied correctly

## File Changes Made

1. `database/schema.sql` - Complete database schema
2. `src/dashibaseConfig.ts` - Updated configuration for real tables
3. `DATABASE_SETUP.md` - Setup instructions (has some markdown linting issues)
