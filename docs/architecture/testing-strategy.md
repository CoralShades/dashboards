# Testing Strategy

## Testing Approach

The application will follow a comprehensive testing strategy to ensure reliability and maintainability.

### Frontend Testing

* **Unit Tests:** Test individual components and hooks using **Vitest** and **React Testing Library**.
* **Integration Tests:** Test component interactions and data flows.
* **E2E Tests:** Use **Playwright** or **Cypress** for end-to-end testing of critical user flows (login, dashboard viewing, Xero connection).

### Backend Testing

* **Database Tests:** Test RLS policies, triggers, and functions using Supabase's testing framework.
* **Edge Function Tests:** Write unit tests for Edge Functions using Deno's built-in test runner.
* **API Tests:** Test API endpoints using integration tests.

### Test Coverage Goals

* **Frontend:** Aim for 80%+ code coverage on critical components.
* **Backend:** Aim for 90%+ coverage on database functions and Edge Functions.

### Continuous Integration

* **CI/CD Pipeline:** Set up GitHub Actions to run tests on every pull request.
* **Pre-deployment Testing:** Run full test suite before deploying to production.

### Testing Tools

| Test Type         | Tool                          |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Frontend Unit     | Vitest + React Testing Library|
| Frontend E2E      | Playwright or Cypress         |
| Backend Functions | Deno Test                     |
| Database Tests    | Supabase Test Framework       |
| API Testing       | Postman or REST Client        |

### Test Scenarios

#### Critical User Flows

1. **User Registration & Login**
   * New user signs up
   * User logs in with valid credentials
   * User logs out

2. **Dashboard Access**
   * User with permissions views dashboard
   * User without permissions is denied access
   * Admin manages dashboard permissions

3. **Xero Integration**
   * User initiates Xero OAuth flow
   * User completes OAuth and tokens are stored
   * User disconnects Xero account
   * Tokens are automatically refreshed

4. **Role-Based Access**
   * Admin can access all features
   * Editor has limited access
   * Viewer can only view dashboards

### Validation Steps

#### Pre-Deployment Checklist

1. ✅ All tests pass
2. ✅ No TypeScript compilation errors
3. ✅ No ESLint warnings (critical)
4. ✅ RLS policies tested and verified
5. ✅ Edge Functions deployed and tested
6. ✅ Environment variables configured
7. ✅ Database migrations applied
8. ✅ OAuth flow tested end-to-end

#### Post-Deployment Verification

1. ✅ Application loads successfully
2. ✅ Users can log in
3. ✅ Dashboards render correctly
4. ✅ Xero connection works
5. ✅ Data sync runs as scheduled
6. ✅ No console errors
7. ✅ Performance metrics within acceptable range

### Security Testing

* **Authentication Tests:** Verify that unauthenticated users cannot access protected routes.
* **Authorization Tests:** Verify that users can only access resources they have permissions for.
* **RLS Tests:** Verify that database policies prevent unauthorized data access.
* **Token Security:** Verify that tokens are encrypted and never exposed in client-side code.

### Performance Testing

* **Load Testing:** Test application performance under expected user load.
* **Database Query Performance:** Analyze slow queries and optimize indexes.
* **Edge Function Performance:** Monitor cold start times and execution duration.
